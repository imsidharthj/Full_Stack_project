# MedicoBud

MedicoBud is a modern medical application built with **React, TypeScript, FastAPI, and Tailwind CSS**. It provides an **interactive interface for disease diagnosis**, predicting conditions like **Fever, Jaundice, Food Poisoning, and Heart Disease** based on user inputs.

---

## File Descriptions

### API (Backend)
The api/ directory contains the FastAPI-based backend, responsible for handling data processing and API requests.

- main.py â€“ Entry point for the FastAPI app, defining API routes.
- database.py â€“ Handles database configuration and local database operations.
- models.py â€“ Defines database models (tables, schemas).
- routes/ â€“ Stores different API route handlers (organized by feature).
- services/ â€“ Contains business logic and data processing before responding to UI requests.

The API reads data from a local database and processes requests from the frontend. It receives user input, processes it in the database, and sends responses back via HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).

### UI (Frontend)
The ui/ directory contains the React + TypeScript frontend, built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Redux for state management.

- components/ â€“ Reusable UI components (buttons, modals, forms, etc.).
- pages/ â€“ Page-level components (e.g., Home, Dashboard, Profile).
- assets/ â€“ Stores images, icons, and other static files.
 
The UI fetches data from the API, displays it dynamically, and allows user interactions. Shadcn UI components are used for an enhanced, interactive user experience.
